# Project Dynamic Password Validation

This project demonstrates dynamic password validation using binary search. It allows you to efficiently validate passwords by performing a binary search on a list of predefined password combinations.

## Overview

The "Project Dynamic Password Validation" is designed to showcase a dynamic password validation system using the binary search algorithm. It enables the efficient validation of passwords from a list of predefined combinations. By applying binary search, the project demonstrates a powerful and time-saving method for password verification.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- C++ compiler with C++11 or later support.
- CMake (optional for building).
- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/findCarolinaCosta/dynamic-password-validation.git
```
Build the project using CMake (optional but recommended):

```bash
    cd dynamic-password-validation
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

Run the compiled binary:
```bash
    ./dynamic-password-validation
```

This program compares linear search and binary search for dynamic password validation, and the results will be displayed in the terminal.

Binary Search Algorithm
Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding a target value in a sorted list. In this project, I used binary search to validate passwords against a sorted list of predefined combinations. Binary search is more efficient when dealing with large datasets and offers a quick way to verify passwords.
